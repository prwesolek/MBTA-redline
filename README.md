# MBTA-redline
This project aims to determine what weather factors - e.g. temperature or precipitation - impact the MBTA redline on time performance. 

The extract-red.py is a python script, which should be ran from the command line, which combines and cleans the raw data from the directory 2018-ontime-performance and the weather data 2018-weather-data.csv. It outputs two csv files: peak-2018.csv and offpeak-2018.csv. The peak-2018.csv file contains the data for the peak hours while the offpeak-2018.csv contains the data for the off-peak howers.
